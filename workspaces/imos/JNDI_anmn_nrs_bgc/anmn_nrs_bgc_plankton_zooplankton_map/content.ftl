<p>This collection currently provides the latest raw data only in "flat table" form (separate row for each taxon in each sample).</p>

<p>These data are also available in analysis-ready (absences included, taxonomic changes managed), raw or binned (taxonomic group, genus, species) abundance products by contacting <a href="mailto:imos-plankton@csiro.au">imos-plankton@csiro.au</a>. All products are also available in bio-volume instead of abundance on request.

<p>A project to make these products available directly via the portal is under way.</p>
