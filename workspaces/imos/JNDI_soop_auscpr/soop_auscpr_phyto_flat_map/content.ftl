<p>Data are available in analysis-ready (absences included, taxonomic changes managed), raw or binned (taxonomic group, genus, species) abundance products at the download stage.</p>

<p><b>The data products downloadable here are a sample only and are not updated with new data or changes in taxonomy.</b> Infrastructure to update and maintain the products is being developed.
In the meantime, updated products can be requested by contacting <a href="mailto:imos-plankton@csiro.au">imos-plankton@csiro.au</a>. All products are also available in bio-volume instead of abundance on request.</p> 

<p>The latest raw data can be downloaded in "flat table" form (separate row for each taxon in each sample) on Step 3.</p>
